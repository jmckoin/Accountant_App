# Accountant Database Application Project
An application built based on following overview:

Overview:
You will build a client/tax return system for a small accounting firm. Your customer (the accounting firm) requires the following from your application:
1. You must store the following information:
- Information about CPAs (Certified Public Accountants). Each CPA will have multiple
-	clients.
-	Information about clients, including name, address, income, and if they have provided tax materials to the firm. Each client will have only one CPA.
-	Information about the tax return, including the status (is it filed or not), timestamp of filing (if it was filed), and if it has been checked by a CPA (‘yes’ automatically if the CPA has filed it, ‘no’ if it was filed by the assistant). Each client can only have one tax return.
2.	Your interface must have the following functions (they can be merged into less/nested options if you want):
-	Add clients
-	Add tax filing assistants
-	Add CPAs
-	Mark if a client has provided their required materials
-	Check if client has provided their required materials
-	Mark if tax return is filed
-	Check if a return for a client is filed
-	Mark if a CPA checked a return
-	Check if a CPA checked a return
